            <p>
                The optimizer can’t run because your{" "}
                <span className="highlight">Echo Bag</span> currently has no usable echoes.
                It only works with echoes that are in your bag (and pass your filters), so with
                an empty bag there are literally <strong>no combinations</strong> to test.
            </p>

            <p>To get meaningful optimizer results, you’ll want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add echoes to your bag</strong> from the Echoes tab (manually or via
                    the parser).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure your <strong>filters aren’t hiding everything</strong> – try loosening
                    set filters or decreasing the “Filter Strength” if you’ve already added echoes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Once your bag has some echoes, the optimizer will be able to generate valid 5-piece,
                cost ≤ 12 combinations and show you the best-performing builds instead of an empty list.
            </p>

                TL;DR: no echoes in, no optimizations out. Fill your bag first, then rerun the

    noValidCombos: (
        <div>
            <h2>(￣﹃￣) your filters are a bit too powerful...</h2>
            <p>
                Your <span className="highlight">Echo Bag</span> does have echoes, but with the
                current settings the optimizer couldn’t find <strong>any valid combinations</strong>.
                In other words, the filters are so strict that nothing passes the rules.
            </p>

            <p>Typical reasons this happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your <strong>Echo Bag</strong> has echoes but not enough to form at least 1 combination of echoes
                    where their summed up costs is valid (≤ 12).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Filter Strength</strong> is too high, so almost all echoes
                    are thrown away before combos are built.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your <strong>set plan</strong> is impossible with the echoes in your bag
                    (for example, forcing a 5-piece set you don’t actually have enough pieces for).
                </li>
                <li>
                    A <strong>main echo lock</strong> is set on an echo that makes it impossible
                    to build a valid cost ≤ 12, 5-piece combo around it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>To fix it, try one or more of these:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decrease the <strong>Filter Strength</strong> so more echoes survive.</li>
                <li>Relax or clear some <strong>sonata set constraints</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                    Temporarily <strong>remove the main echo lock</strong> to see if valid combos
                    appear again.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Once at least one valid combination exists, the optimizer will show a non-zero
                permutation count and you’ll be able to run it normally.
            </p>

            <p

                    marginTop: "1rem",

                TL;DR: Make sure you have usable echoes in your bag and soften the filters a bit, then try again (ง •̀_•́)ง.

    rangeLimitsTooStrict: (
        <div>
            <h2>｡°(°.◜ᯅ◝°)°｡ range limits said “no” to everything</h2>
            <p>
                The optimizer <strong>did</strong> run and it <strong>did</strong> find echo
                combinations, but every single one was thrown out by your{" "}
                <span className="highlight">Range Limits</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In other words: there <em>are</em> valid cost ≤ 12, 5-piece builds formed from the echoes in your bag,
                just none that satisfy all the min/max constraints you set for your range limits.
            </p>

            <p>Common situations where this happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You set very high <strong>minimums</strong> on several stats at once
                    (e.g., Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK%, and Energy Regen all needing “endgame” values).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You added tight <strong>maximums</strong> that conflict with your minimums
                    (for example, Crit Rate ≥ 70% but ≤ 60%).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>How to loosen the chokehold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Really, just clear them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only enforce hard caps on one or two at a time until you see results again.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After you dial the limits back, rerun the optimizer. As soon as at least one build
                fits inside your <span className="highlight">Range Limits</span>, results will start appearing again.
            </p>

                <li>

                    Try a <strong>modern Chromium-based browser</strong> (like the latest Chrome

                <li>
                    Or just switch the optimizer to <strong>CPU mode</strong> – it’s slower, but
